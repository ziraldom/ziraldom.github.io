    <h1>Favorite Video Games</h1>
    <h3>How I rank my favorite video games.</h3>
    <p>There isn't too much that goes into ranking them. All it comes down to is how much I enjoyed the story, the characters, and the fictional world. Personal preference probably plays a part into it. Oh! We also can't forget about if we get emotionally attached to the characters... surely not</p>
